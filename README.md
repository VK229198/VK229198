# Hi there, I'm Vishvesh 👋

🚀 **BTech Student | AI Enthusiast | Researcher**

I'm currently a **3rd-year BTech student at RV University** with a passion for **Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Embedded Systems**. I enjoy working on projects that combine software, hardware, and optimization techniques.

## 🔬 Research & Interests
- **Genetic Algorithm-based Timetable Scheduling**  
- **Reinforcement Learning-based Traffic Management in SDN**
- **Worked on a VGG- like model with more hidden layers for efficient and accurate PCOS detection**
- **LLM Chatbot for translating code-mix language to english**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python, C++, C, Java, SQL, Dart  
- **Frameworks:** Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Mesa (Multi-Agent Systems), Flutter
- **Embedded Systems:** Arduino, LoRa, GPS Modules  
- **Databases:** MySQL, Google Sheets API  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## 📌 Notable Projects
- **[Genetic Algorithm-based Timetable Scheduler](https://github.com/VK229198/Timetable_Generator)**: Optimized scheduling using GA for university courses.  
- **[Autonomous Network Management with RL](https://github.com/VK229198/Traffic-Management-with-RL)**: Applied RL techniques for network self-optimization.  
- **[Navi Bus - Real-time Bus Tracking System](https://github.com/VK229198/Navi_Bus)**: A LoRa-based VLSI project for public transportation tracking.  
- **[QR-based Workshop Attendance System](https://github.com/VK229198/QR_Attendance)**: A Flask & Google Sheets-based automated attendance system.  

## 📄 Research & Publications
- Published and presented a paper in CIMA-2025 on the topic of AI-driven Timetable Scheduling
- Published a paper in 16th ICCCNT on the topic of RL based SDN Traffic Management
- Wrote a paper on comparing VGG-19 model to our own architecture of a VGG like model for PCOS prediction
- Working on a project a hopeful reasearch on the topic of code-mix translation based Chatbot
